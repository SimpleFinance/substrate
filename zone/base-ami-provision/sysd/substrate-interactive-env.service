# Renders Substrate variables for interactive tooling into /etc/substrate/interactive.env
#
# This unit runs relatively early in the boot process (after cloud-init, so
# networking is up and running). It's job is to read EC2 metadata and user data
# passed in from Terraform and create a file "/etc/substrate/node.env", which
# contains all the node-specific configuration variables we'll need in other
# units.
